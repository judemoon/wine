# Expore and Summarize Physicochemical Property Data for Whie Wine Quality  
### July 2017, by Jude Moon

# 1.Overview
In this project, I will use a white wine quality data set for [Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine](http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/about-vinho-verde), whose data were collected and published by [Cortez et al (2009)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609001377?via%3Dihub). This tidy data set contains 4,898 white wines with 11 variables on quantifying the physicochemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Details and units of the variables are provided [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt). The objectives of the analysis is to explore data to determine (1) whether any relationship between the physicochemical properties and sensory quality exists and (2) if so, which physicochemical properties are the most effective to describe quality, in other words, which properties are highly correlated with the quality score.

# 2. Analysis
## 2.1.2 Univariate Plots Section
### Data Summary
#### What are the data types of the columns?
```{r echo=FALSE}
# Display data type of each column
str(ww)
```

All columns are numeric or continuous, except X and quality. X is wine sample ID, so changing to factor data type would make more sense.

#### What are the data ranges of variables?
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_Summary}
# Change X from int to factor
ww$X <- factor(ww$X, ordered = F)  
summary(ww)
```

The data range of each variable varies, e.g., volatile.acidity ranges from 0.08 to 1.1 while total.sulfur.dioxide ranges from 9 to 440. This suggests that data transformation such as standardization might be required to compare two variables. 

### Extract numeric variables only to create a subset dataframe
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create new dataframes including only numeric variables
ww_subset <- subset(ww, select = -c(X)) # excluding column X
colnames(ww_subset)
```


#### Is there any missing values (na) or any zero values?
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_Missing}
#summary(is.na(ww))
summary(ww == 0)
```

This is no missing value. Variable citric.acid has 19 zeros. I will assume that they are true zeros.

### Quality score: response variable or label feature
#### Can I engineer this variable simpler to interpret?
I will create categorical variables of quality which is integer variable ranged from 3 to 9. One way is to convert into 7 classes (called **quality.order**) and the other is into 3 classes(called **quality.con** and **quality.lib**), where I can simply interpret as bad, ok, and good quality.
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_quality.order}
# Change from int to ordered factor
ww$quality.order <- factor(ww$quality, ordered = T)
str(ww$quality.order)
```

#### What is distribution of quality?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a bar plot, similar to histogram
plot(ww$quality.order, xlab = 'quality.order', ylab='count') 

# Create a function to generate a proportion table in percentage
ProportionTable <- function(col) {
  freq <- table(col)
  prop <- (freq/length(col))*100
  return(list("% of each group", prop))
}

# Create a proportion table for quality.order
ProportionTable(ww$quality.order)
```

Quality is normally distributed. Quality score 6 is the most common quality for white wines (45%). Most white wines have a quality score between 5 and 6, which accounting for 75% of the total. If I predict that a product of white wine is in quality of 5 or 6, there will be 75% chance to be correct. White wines with a quality score between 5 and 7 and that between 4 and 8 are 92.6% and 99.5% respectively. 

#### What are the distributions of 3-classes variables?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create new varaibles by cutting into 3 buckets
ww$quality.con <- cut(ww$quality, c(2, 5, 6, 9)) # conservative cutoff
ww$quality.lib <- cut(ww$quality, c(2, 4, 7, 9)) # liberal cutoff

# Craete distribution plots and proportion tables for the new variables
plot(ww$quality.con, xlab = 'quality.con', ylab='count')
ProportionTable(ww$quality.con)
plot(ww$quality.lib, xlab = 'quality.lib', ylab='count')
ProportionTable(ww$quality.lib)
```
I created 2 new variables; each includes 3-classes. One is that I named **quality.con** which cuts off the quality in a conservative way. This considers that wines with the score <6 are low quality, 6 are medium quality, and >6 are high quality. 

The other I named **quality.lib** separates quality in a liberal way, where wine with a wide ranged score from 5 to 7 are considered as ok quality, <5 are low quality, and >7 are high quality.

The distribution of quality.con is relatively even in the 3 classes, while that of quality.lib varies. The purpose of using quality.con would be to find general trends of low and high quality wine, while quality.lib would be better for screening exceptionally low or high quality wine.

### Variables related to features
I sorted some of variables into a related feature in order to organize variables as a meaningful order.


| Order |     Feature     |                        Variables                        |
|:-----:|:---------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|
|   1   |       body      |                         alcohol                         |
|   2   |      sweet      |                      residual.sugar                     |
|   3   |      salty      |                        chlorides                        |
|   4   |      dense      |                         density                         |
|   5   | sour or acidity |   pH, fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, and citric.acid  |
|   6   |   preservative  | sulphates,total.sulfur.dioxide, and free.sulfur.dioxide |


### Alcohol content

#### How the alcohol variable is distributed?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a histogram 
qplot(x = alcohol, data = ww, binwidth = 0.1, color = I('black'))+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$alcohol), max(ww$alcohol)),
                     breaks = seq(8, max(ww$alcohol), 1))

```

The distribution is little bit skewed to the left. But I don't think that it requires transformation because the skewness seems minor. 


#### What are the distributions of 4-groups or 3-groups variables?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create new varaibles by cutting into buckets
ww$alcohol.bucket <- cut(ww$alcohol,
                             c(7.9, 9.4, 10.4, 11.4, 14.20)) # evenly cutting into 4 groups
ww$alcohol.body <- cut(ww$alcohol,
                             c(7, 11, 13, 15)) # conventional grouping into 3 groups

# Create a function to generate a histogram with color encoding of categorical variable,
# a table, and a proportion table
Plot1 <- function(alcohol.group) {
  a <- plot(alcohol.group, xlab='alcohol', ylab='count')
  b <- table(alcohol.group)
  c <- ProportionTable(alcohol.group)
  return(list(a, b, c))
}

# Explore distribution of alcohol variable
Plot1(ww$alcohol.bucket)
Plot1(ww$alcohol.body)
```

The distributions of < 9.5, 9.5-10.4, 10.5-11.4, and >11.4 are even, so I created a new variable called **alcohol.bucket**, which separated alcohol content into 4 groups. 

Additionally, as a conventionally rule, light-bodied wines are 7-11 % alcohol, medium run 11-13%, and full-bodied are over 13%. The body of the wine is how it feels in your mouth. When a wine is full-bodied, it completely coats the palate and tends to feel heavier in the mouth. Also, the texture of the wine either smooth/velvety or coarse/brash contributes to feeling in the mouth. In addition to alcohol.bucket, I created a new variable called **alcohol.body**, which separated alcohol content into 3 groups. The distriubtion of conventional way cutoff was imbalanced, with mostly (68%) being light-bodied (alcohol <= 11). 

### Sugar content
#### How the residual.sugar variable is distributed? Any new variables are needed?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of residual.sugar variable
sugar.dist <- qplot(x = residual.sugar, data = ww, binwidth =0.1)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$residual.sugar), max(ww$residual.sugar)),
                     breaks = seq(min(ww$residual.sugar), max(ww$residual.sugar), 10))

# Create new varaible by cutting into 2 buckets
ww$sugar.bucket <- cut(ww$residual.sugar, c(0.5, 2.5, 32)) 

# Transform x to log10
sugar.dist.log <- qplot(x = residual.sugar, data = ww, 
                        binwidth = 0.02, fill = sugar.bucket)+
  scale_x_log10()

grid.arrange(sugar.dist, sugar.dist.log,  ncol=2)
ProportionTable(ww$sugar.bucket)
```

The distribution of residual sugar content is skewed with a right long tail. Thus, the log10 transformation helps better understand the distribution of sugar content. It appears to be bimodal with sugar content peaking at around 1.5 or so and again at 8 g/L or so. I created a new variable called **sugar.bucket**, which separated sugar content into 2 groups: <=2.5 (35%) and >2.5 (65%). 

According to [data info notes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt), it is rare to find wines with less than 1 g/L of sugar. And wines with greater than 45 g/L sugar are considered sweet.

#### What percentage of white wines are sugar content less than 1 g/L sugar or greater than 45 g/L sugar?
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_residual.sugar}
# Craete a function to calculate percentages of wines with less than the value i 
proportion <- function(col, i) {
  prop <- sum(col < i) / length(col) * 100
  return(prop)
}

proportion(ww$residual.sugar, 1)
100-proportion(ww$residual.sugar, 45)
```

The white wine less than 1 g/L is 1.6% of the total. And sweet white wine is only 0.02% of the total, which is very small. I am not sure if "Vinho Verde" white wines are not sweet in general, or if the cutoff of sugar content is more for red wine in general. 

#### How the sugar contents are distributed for red wines?
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rw <- read.csv('wineQualityReds.csv')
summary(rw$residual.sugar)
```
Just quick overviewing the stats of residual sugar content from red wines, the Midian is 2.2 and the max is 15.5 g/L which are a lot lower than white wines. Thus, the cutoff (45 g/L) of sugar content for sweet wines is not for red wines either.

### NaCl(salt) content
#### How the NaCl content variable is distributed?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of chlorides variable
NaCl.dist <- qplot(x = chlorides, data = ww, binwidth =0.001)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$chlorides), max(ww$chlorides)),
                     breaks = seq(min(ww$chlorides), max(ww$chlorides), 0.1))

# Transform x to log10
NaCl.dist.log <- qplot(x = chlorides, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_log10()

grid.arrange(NaCl.dist, NaCl.dist.log, ncol=2)
summary(ww$chlorides)

# Calculate percentages of wines with less than 0.1 g/L
proportion(ww$chlorides, 0.1)
```
The distribution of NaCl content is skewed with a right long tail. Thus, the log10 transformation helps better understand the distribution of NaCl content, which looks close to normal. A majority (97.8%) of white wines are less than 0.1 g/L in NaCl content and those between 0.04 and 0.05 are common.

### Density
#### How the density variable is distributed?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of density variable
density.dist <- qplot(x = density, data = ww, binwidth =0.0001)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$density), max(ww$density)),
                     breaks = seq(0.980,  max(ww$density), 0.01))

# Zoom in the x scale
density.dist.zoom <- qplot(x = density, data = ww, binwidth =0.0001)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$density), quantile(ww$density, 0.999)),
                     breaks = seq(0.980, quantile(ww$density, 0.999), 0.004))

grid.arrange(density.dist, density.dist.zoom, ncol=2)
summary(ww$density)

# Calculate percentages of wines with less than 1 Kg/L
100-proportion(ww$density, 1)
```

The lightest and heaviest wines are 0.9871 and 1.0390 Kg/L in density, respectively. Most white wines are between 0.9917 and 0.9961 Kg/L in density. Although the distribution is skewed to the right, log or square root transformations did not improve normality. Excluding top 0.1% helps to better understand the distribution. 
Density possibly contributes to taste of wine. Density depends on the alcohol and sugar contents. The wines heavier than or equal to water (1 Kg/L) are rare (1.9%). 
 
### Acidity including pH, fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, and citric.acid
#### pH
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of pH variable
qplot(x = pH, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$pH), max(ww$pH)),
                     breaks = seq(2.7, max(ww$pH), 0.1))

summary(ww$pH)
```

#### tartaric acid content (nonvolatile or fixed acidity)
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of fixed.acidity variable
tartaric.dist <- qplot(x = fixed.acidity, data = ww, binwidth =0.1)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$fixed.acidity), max(ww$fixed.acidity)),
                     breaks = seq(3, max(ww$fixed.acidity), 1))

# Transform x to log10
tartaric.dist.log <- qplot(x = fixed.acidity, data = ww, binwidth =0.005)+
  scale_x_log10()

grid.arrange(tartaric.dist, tartaric.dist.log, ncol=2)

summary(ww$fixed.acidity)
```


#### acetic acid content (volatile acidity)
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of volatile.acidity variable
acetic.dist <- qplot(x = volatile.acidity, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$volatile.acidity), max(ww$volatile.acidity)),
                     breaks = seq(0.1, max(ww$volatile.acidity), 0.2))

# Transform x to log10
acetic.dist.log <- qplot(x = volatile.acidity, data = ww, binwidth =0.02)+
  scale_x_log10()

grid.arrange(acetic.dist, acetic.dist.log, ncol=2)

summary(ww$volatile.acidity)

```

#### citric acid content
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of citric.acid variable
citric.dist <- qplot(x = citric.acid, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$citric.acid), max(ww$citric.acid)),
                     breaks = seq(min(ww$citric.acid), max(ww$citric.acid), 0.4))

# Transform x to square root
citric.dist.sqrt <- qplot(x = citric.acid, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_sqrt()

grid.arrange(citric.dist, citric.dist.sqrt, ncol=2)

print("Count and proportion of 0")
summary(ww$citric.acid == 0)  # count of the wines with 0 g/L citric acid
sum(ww$citric.acid == 0) / length(ww$acetic.bucket) * 100 # calculate percentage of the winew with 0 g/L

print("Count and proportion of 0.49")
summary(ww$citric.acid == 0.49)  # count of the wines with 0.49 g/L citric acid
sum(ww$citric.acid == 0.49) / length(ww$acetic.bucket) * 100 # calculate percetage of the winew with 0.49 g/L

# Zoom in the x scale
qplot(x = citric.acid, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.45, 0.55),
                     breaks = seq(0.45, 0.55, 0.01))

```

(1) pH is already in log term so the distribution is normal. The lowest and the highest in pH of white wine are 2.72 and 3.82, respectively. The most common pH was between 3.1 and 3.3.

(2) tartaric acid: the lowest and highest in tartaric acid content are 3.8 and 14.2 g/L, respectively. Most white wines are between 6.3 and 7.3 g/L in tartaric acid. 

(3) acetic acid: the lowest and highest in acetic acid content are 0.08 and 1.1 g/L, respectively. Most white wines are between 0.21 and 0.32 g/L in acetic acid. 

(4) citric acid: the lowest and highest in citric acid content are 0 and 1.66 g/L, respectively. There are 19 zeros. Most white wines are between 0.27 and 0.39 g/L in citric acid. There is unusual high count at 0.49 g/L. 

Because the distributions of the three acid variables are skewed to the right, log transformation helps to get better distribution for tartaric and acetic acids, and the values of citric acid (having zeros) are square root transformed. 

According to the [data info notes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt), excess amount of acetic acid can cause an unpleasant and vinegar taste, while citric acid can add freshness and flavor to wines. Thus, the 4 variables indicating acidity of wine are likely related to each other as well as to wine quality. 

### Antimicrobial and antioxidant contents, including sulphates, total.sulfur.dioxide, and free.sulfur.dioxide
#### K2SO4 content (potassium sulphate)
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distsribution of sulphates variable
K2SO4.dist <- qplot(x = sulphates, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$sulphates), max(ww$sulphates)),
                     breaks = seq(0.2, max(ww$sulphates), 0.1))

# Transform x to log10
K2SO4.dist.log <- qplot(x = sulphates, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_log10()

grid.arrange(K2SO4.dist, K2SO4.dist.log, ncol=2)

summary(ww$sulphates)
```

#### Total SO2 content
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of total.sulfur.dioxide variable
t.SO2.dist <- qplot(x = total.sulfur.dioxide, data = ww, binwidth = 1)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide), max(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide)),
                     breaks = seq(min(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide), max(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide), 50))

# Transform x to square root
t.SO2.dist.sqrt <- qplot(x = total.sulfur.dioxide, data = ww, binwidth =0.1)+
  scale_x_sqrt()

grid.arrange(t.SO2.dist, t.SO2.dist.sqrt, ncol=2)

summary(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide)
```

#### Free SO2 content
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of free.sulfur.dioxide variable
f.SO2.dist <- qplot(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, data = ww, binwidth =1)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide), max(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide)),
                     breaks = seq(0, max(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide), 50))

# Transform x to log10
f.SO2.dist.log <- qplot(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, data = ww, binwidth =0.02)+
  scale_x_log10()

grid.arrange(f.SO2.dist, f.SO2.dist.log, ncol=2)

summary(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide)

summary(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide > 50)  # count of the wines with higher than 50 mg/L

sum(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide > 50) / length(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide) * 100  # percentages of wines with less than 50 mg/L
```
(1) sulphates: the lowest and highest in sulphates content are 0.22 and 1.08 g/L, respectively. Most white wines are between 0.41 and 0.55 g/L in sulphates. 

(2) total SO2: the lowest and highest in total SO2 content are 9 and 440 mg/L, respectively. Most white wines are between 108 and 167 mg/L in total SO2. 

(3) free SO2: the lowest and highest in free SO2content are 2 and 289 mg/L, respectively. Most white wines are between 23 and 46 mg/L in free SO2. 

Because the distributions of all three variables are skewed to the right, log transformation helps to get better distribution for sulphates and free SO2. And the values of total SO2 are square root transformed. 

According to the [data info notes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt), free SO2 prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine, but over 50 mg/L of free SO2 (about 18%), SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine. Thus, free SO2 is likely related to wine quality. In addition, sulfates are an additive that contributes to SO2 gas, and so all three variables indicating sulfur content are likely related to each other.


## 2.1.2 Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?
There were 4,898 white wines in the dataset with 1 sensory data (quality score) and 11 physicochemical properties (alcohol, sugar, NaCl, tartaric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, K2SO4, total and free SO2 contents, pH, and density). All physicochemical properties were numeric variables, and the quality variable was integer.

Other observations:
- The most common white wines were quality score of 6.
- Alcohol content ranged from 8 to 14.2% and the median alcohol was 10.4%.
- Sugar content ranged from 0.6 to 65.8 g/L and most white wines were around 2 and 10 g/L.
- Salt content was less than 0.1 g/L for most white wines (98%) with the median of 0.043 g/L.
- Density ranged from 0.9871 to 1.0390 Kg/L with the median of 0.9937 Kg/L.
- Acidity ranged from pH 2.72 to pH 3.82 with the median of pH 3.18.
- The medians of tartaric, acetic, and citric acid contents were 6.8, 0.26, and 0.32 g/L, respectively.
- The medians of K2SO4, total and free SO2 contents were 0.47 g/L, 134 mg/L, and 34 mg/L, respectively.


### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
The main feature in the data set was quality score. I would like to determine which physicochemical properties (input variables) are best for predicting the quality of white wine (output variable). The measurements of physicochemical properties could be responsible for smell and taste of white wine. For examples, sugar for sweetness, NaCl for saltiness, acidity for sourness, acetic acid for vinegary taste, citric acid for citrus flavor, and free SO2 for pungent odor. I think that the balance among these flavors can contribute to the wine quality, thus some combination of physicochemical properties can be used to complement sensory tests or build a predictive model to sensory tests.

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
The article (Cortez 2009) hinted that there is relationship between alcohol and residual sugar contents since alcohol production depends on grape sugar level and fermentation process. After reading some basics about wine tasting, too much or too little of alcohol, sweets, acids are not preferred and balancing among the ingredients is required for good quality. Focusing on high quality wines to compare how physicochemical properties of high quality wines are distributed differently from the others might help to understand any consistent trends for high quality. 

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?
I created 6 new variables including quality.order, quality.con, quality.lib, alcohol.bucket, alcohol.body, sugar.bucket. 

- quality.order is a variable changed from existing variable quality, which was numeric, to ordered factor with 7 levels.
- quality.con is a variable also changed from variable quality, by cutting into evenly distributed 3 levels. 
- quality.lib is a variable also changed from variable quality, by cutting into unproportionally distributed 3 levels.
- alcohol.bucket is a variable changed from existing variable alcohol, by evenly cutting numbers into 4 levels. 
- alcohol.body is a variable also changed from alcohol to 3-leveled categoroy, by following conventional body levels of wines.
- sugar.bucket is a variable changed from existing variable residual.sugar and separated into 2 levels guided by bimodal distribution. 

Reasoning: ordered or categorical factors are useful to color data as well as draw statistics on plots for further analysis.

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?
I log- or square root-transformed the right skewed distributions. The distributions of NaCl, sugar, tartaric and acetic acids, K2SO4, free SO2 were strongly skewed to the right, so log-transformation was used to reduce the strong right skewness. The transformed distribution for sugar appeared bimodal with the sugar peaking at around 1.5 or so and again at 8 g/L or so. Some wines had zero values of citric acid, so square root transformation was applied to reduce the right skewness for citric acid. The distribution of total SO2 was weakly skewed, so squared root transformation was used.



## 2.2.1 Bivariate Plots Section

### Multivariate Outliers
I will use multivariate approach to detect outliers instead of looking at all pairs of variables using ww_subset. This way I can detect universal outliers shown across all the variables. But there might be more detectable outliners by pair-wise approach.

#### Is there any outlier?

**chi square plot of ww_subset before removing any outlier**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create Chi-Square Plot to identify outliers using mvoutlier package
# The user interaction of chisq plot works as running this code directly on the Console
# Use left click to identify the first outlier and remove it from the chisq plot

#chisq.plot(ww_subset) 
```


![chisq.plot](chisq_all.jpg)


Observations left out:
2782

The outlier detected is X = 2782 with Sq. Mahalanobis Distance (MD) of 3800. 

#### What are the values of variables for X=2782?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Identify the outlier from chi square plot using the interacting plot 
ww[2782, ]
```

Observation 2782 has extreme values in acetic acid, sugar, and density, and the values of the other variables are far from the medians. I decided to delete this row.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Remove observation of 2782
ww <- ww[-c(2782), ]
ww_subset <- ww_subset[-c(2782), ]

# Dimension of dataframe of ww and ww_subset after removing the outlier
print("Dimensions of dataframe, ww")
dim(ww)
print("Dimensions of dataframe, ww_subset")
dim(ww_subset)
```
Now, the dataframes have 4897 observations.

**chi square plot of ww_subset after removing the first outlier**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Enter the code below on the Console directly for user interaction

#chisq.plot(ww_subset) 
```


![chisq.plot](chisq_rem_1.jpg)

The maximum Sq. MD decreases from 3800 to 1200. 

#### What are the values of variables for X=485?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Identify the next outlier from chi square plot using the interacting plot 
ww[485, ]
```

Although it seems very good improvement in dereasing Sq. MD, the cutoff of Sq. MD value can be little bit arbitrary. So, I decide to keep the next outlier (X=485) by looking at its values. Only NaCl is extreme value and the values of other variables are not considered as extreme. And I think this particular data point is valuable to keep. 

I have noticed that the columns' names are too long for such scatterplot matrix so I will rename all the columns for simplicity and readability on the plots.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, rename_col}
# Rename variables 
ww_subset <- rename(ww_subset, 
       c("alcohol" = "alco",
         "residual.sugar" = "sugar",
         "chlorides" = "NaCl",
         "density" = "dens",
         "fixed.acidity" = "tart", 
         "volatile.acidity" = "acet", 
         "citric.acid" = "citr",          
         "sulphates" = "K2SO4",
         "free.sulfur.dioxide" = "fSO2",
         "total.sulfur.dioxide" = "tSO2",
         "quality" = "qual"))
```

I will generate a new dataframe that includes log- or square root-transformed data according to the univariate analysis results.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, transformed_dataframe}
# Create another dataframe including transformed data
tart.log <- log10(ww_subset$tart)
acet.log <- log10(ww_subset$acet)
citr.sqrt <- sqrt(ww_subset$citr)
suga.log <- log10(ww_subset$sugar)
NaCl.log <- log10(ww_subset$NaCl)
fSO2.log <- log10(ww_subset$fSO2)
tSO2.sqrt <- sqrt(ww_subset$tSO2)
dens <- ww_subset$dens
pH <- ww_subset$pH
SO4.log <- log10(ww_subset$K2SO4)
alco <- ww_subset$alco
qual <- ww_subset$qual

ww_trans <- data.frame(alco, suga.log, NaCl.log, dens,
                       pH, tart.log, acet.log, citr.sqrt,
                       SO4.log, tSO2.sqrt, fSO2.log, qual)
```

#### What does chi-square plot look like after variable transformation?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Enter the codes below on the Console directly for user interaction

#chisq.plot(ww_trans)
#chisq.plot(ww_trans[ , !names(ww_trans) %in% c("suga.log")]) # without sugar variable
```

**chi square plot of ww_trans**

![chisq.plot](chisq_trans.jpg)



**chi square plot of ww_trans without suga.log**

![chisq.plot](chisq_trans_nosug.jpg)

I notice a great difference in range of x-axis where the range of Sq MD decreases from 1200 to 200. By transforming variables, it helps reduce overall outliers, plus plotting it without sugar variable improves a lot (Sq. MD around 100).

### Numeric variables analysis: regressions

### Correlation Matrix

#### What pairs of variables have strong correlations?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
### Scatterplot Matrix
# Create a scatter plot matrix
#ggpairs(ww_trans, 
#        lower = list(continuous = wrap(ggally_points, size = 0.2)),
#        upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size = 4, color = 'black'))) + 
#  theme_void()

# Create a correlation matrix
ggcorr(ww_trans, label = TRUE, label_round = 3) # add correlation coefficients with 3 digits after decimal point 

```

**Summary of findings from correlation matrix:**

- The main feature of interest is quality. Alcohol, density, NaCl, acetic acid, and total SO2 seem to have medium to weak correlation with quality score. 
- Other than main features, density is an interesting variable, which has strong correlations with alcohol, sugar, and total SO2 and weak correlations with NaCl, free SO2, and tartaric acid. 
- Alcohol is correlated with NaCl, total SO2, sugar, and free SO2. 
- pH is correlated with tartaric and citric acid and K2SO4, but not with acetic acid. 
- Citric acid was weakly correlated with tartaric and acetic acids. 
- Free and total SO2 was strongly correlated. 
- Sugar was correlated with free and total SO2. 
- NaCl and total SO2 weakly were correlated.





### Correlation Network Matrix

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
qgraph(cor(ww_trans))

print("Correlation Coefficient 0.2 or higher")
qgraph(cor(ww_trans), minimum=0.2, edge.labels=TRUE, edge.label.cex=1.5)
```



#### What are the r-square values between quality vs. alcohol and quality vs. density?
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Build the Linear Model
qual.alco1 <- lm(quality ~ alcohol, data = ww)
qual.alco2 <- lm(quality ~ alcohol, data = ww[ww$quality>4, ]) # subset quality higher than 4
qual.dens <- lm(quality ~ density, data = ww)
mtable(qual.alco1, qual.alco2, qual.dens, sdigits = 3)
```

Alcohol can explain 19% of the variance in quality score and density can 10%. The subset of data with quality higher than 4 shows that alcohol can explain 22% of the variance in quality.

### Categorical variable analysis: boxplot or density plot

### Boxplots grouped by quality.con

I will create boxplots of all physicochemical properties grouped by quality.cons (<6, 6, >6) to find general trends. Firstly, I will look at the boxplots of all variables and then I will investigate further on individual variable vs. quality if any interesting trend is shown. 

#### Is there any noticeable trend from low and middle to high quality, which was not detected from correlation analysis?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a function to generate a boxplot with x-axis as quality.con and y-axis as input column
Plot2 <- function(col, Quality, lab) {
  qplot(x= Quality, y= col, geom = 'boxplot', ylab = lab)+ 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/10, color = 'royalblue')
}

# Iterate every column to generate boxplot from ww_trans dateframe
for (i in 1:11) {
  print(Plot2(ww_trans[ , i], ww$quality.con, colnames(ww_trans)[i]))
}
```

**Summary of findings from boxplots:**

- Alcohol, NaCl, density, and pH seem to have consistent trends from low to high quality wines. For the other properties, in contrast, the high quality wines share a similar distribution of the other level of quality. 
- It is surprising to see some consistent trends of decreasing sugar with increasing quality from the boxplot although there is no correlation between sugar and quality (r = -0.065). This makes me wonder if linear relationship was hidden due to bimodality. And I will investigate sugar variable further in the later section.

Although boxplots show the general trends, I am not sure whether the differences are statistically significant or not. Thus, I will perform one-way ANOVA test on each variable by quality.con.


#### Are the differences statistically significant?

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots_ANOVA}
# Create a function to generate ANOVA table
aov_table <- function (col) {
  col.aov <- aov(col ~ ww$quality.con)
  summary(col.aov)
}

# Iterate every column to generate an ANOVA table from ww_trans dateframe
for (i in 1:11) {
  a <- colnames(ww_trans)[i] 
  b <- aov_table(ww_trans[ , i])
  print(list(a, b))
}
```
Apperantly, the ANOVA test is not very helpful in this case because all variables significantly vary by quality.con.  

### Density plots grouped by quality.lib

I will create density plots of all physicochemical properties grouped by quality.lib (<5, 5-7, >7) to find the trends of low-end and high-end cases. The advantage of density plot is the area under the curve is normalized for imbalanced class sizes. Agian, the purpose of drawing density plots all together is to look at the plots of all variables to determine which variables I need to do further investigation. 

#### Is there any noticeable trend from low to high quality?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a function to generate a boxplot with x-axis as quality.con and y-axis as input column
Plot3 <- function(col, quality, lab) {
  qplot(x= col, color = quality, geom = 'density', xlab = lab)+
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdBu")+
    theme_dark()
}

# Iterate every columns to generate boxplots from ww_trans dateframe
for (i in 1:11) {
  print(Plot3(ww_trans[ , i], ww$quality.lib, colnames(ww_trans)[i]))
}
```


**Summary of findings from density plots:**

- The density plots of alcohol, NaCl, density, and pH are reconfirming that for these properties the distributions of very high quality differs from that of very low quality.
- SO4 of high quality wine has slightly different distribution from medium and low quality wine. 
- acetic acid, total SO2 and free SO2 seem to have distinct trends of low quality wine compared to mediumn and high quality wine, which were not detected from boxplots. And I will investigate these variable further in the later section.

### Density plots and regression grouped by sugar.bucket
Due to bimodality of residual.sugar distribution, the regression and density plot could not detect clear trends. So, I will take look at the distributions separately by two groups (<2.5, >2.5).

#### What are the distributions of residual.sugar in the two separate groups? And what are the distribution of quality in the two groups?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create density plots separated by sugar.bucket
sugar.freq.log <- qplot(x= residual.sugar, data = ww, color = sugar.bucket, geom = 'density')+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdBu")+
  theme_dark()

suga.qual.freq <- qplot(x = quality, data = ww, binwidth = 1, geom = 'density', color = sugar.bucket)
  scale_color_brewer()+
  theme_dark()

grid.arrange(sugar.freq.log, suga.qual.freq, ncol=2)

print("residual.sugar")
by(ww$residual.sugar, ww$sugar.bucket, summary)

print("quality")
by(ww$quality, ww$sugar.bucket, summary)
```


The distribution of each sub-group by sugar is close to normal with its own central. Low sugar group (<2.5) has a median of 1.5 while high sugar group (>2.5) had a median of 8.2. Despite the bimodality of residual.sugar distribution, the quality in both groups is distributed very similarly, with the quality median of 6. 

#### Do correlations between sugar and quality differ in the two groups?
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a function to draw scatterplots with linear fit line
Plot4 <- function(dataset, x, y, z, opts = NULL) {
  ggplot(dataset, aes_string(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +
   geom_point(alpha = 1/10, position = position_jitter(h = 0), size = 2) +
   geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
   scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
}

qual.suga1 <- Plot4(ww, "quality", "residual.sugar", NULL)+ 
  scale_y_log10()
qual.suga2 <- Plot4(ww, "quality", "residual.sugar", "sugar.bucket") + 
  scale_y_log10()

grid.arrange(qual.suga1, qual.suga2, ncol=2)

# Correlation on each group
print("(0.5,2.5]")
with(subset(ww, sugar.bucket == "(0.5,2.5]"), cor.test(residual.sugar, quality))
print("(2.5,32]")
with(subset(ww, sugar.bucket == "(2.5,32]"), cor.test(residual.sugar, quality))
```
The correlation with quality is improved a little bit by separating into two groups. Low sugar group (0.5,2.5] is positively correlated with quality (r=0.172), while high sugar group (2.5,32] is negatively correlated with quality (r=-0.156).

### Relationship between freeSO2 vs. quality
The density plot of freeSO2 showed an interesting trend although linear regression and boxplot did not show any promising trends. Low quality wines are relatively more distributed to high-end as well as low-end freeSO2 while medium and high quality wines remain at the middle level of freeSO2. I wonder if too high or too low amounts of freeSO2 are related to low quality of wine.

#### What are the distributions of quality in the bucket by freeSO2?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a new varaible by cutting into 4 buckets
ww$freeSO2.bucket <- cut(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide,
                             c(1, 5, 50, 120, 290))

# Create a function to generate a output set of proportion table, density plots, and summary table
Plot5 <- function(col, bucket) {
  a <- ProportionTable(bucket)
  
  b <- qplot(x = quality, data = ww, geom = 'density', color = bucket)+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdBu")+
  theme_dark()
  
  c <- Plot3(col, ww$quality.order, NULL)
  
  d <- "quality"
  e <- by(ww$quality, bucket, summary)
  
  return(list(a, b, c, d, e))
}

Plot5(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide, ww$freeSO2.bucket)
```
According to [data info notes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt), free SO2 over 50 mg/L becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine, but the measurement of free SO2 alone is not necessary to determine wine quality. 

Majority of wines (82%) have free SO2 below 50 mg/L. The density plot shows that the quality of wine with below and above 50 mg/L of free SO2 are distributed similarly. However, the quality of extreme case (1% of the wine samples) where free SO2 are lower than 5 mg/L (1% of the sample size) or higher than 120 mg/L (0.1% of the sample size) is shown to be low. So, if white wine has too little or too much free SO2, the quality unlikely would be higher than 6. This suggest that free SO2 is required at a certain level (20-50 mg/L) to compromise between preservation purpose (antioxidant) and good smell, but there is no linear relationship between free SO2 and quality.

### Relationship between totalSO2 vs. quality
Total SO2 has a similar trend but a lesser extent like freeSO2 has.

#### What are the distributions of quality in the bucket by totalSO2?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a new varaible by cutting into 4 buckets
ww$totalSO2.bucket <- cut(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide,
                             c(8, 30, 50, 250, 440))

Plot5(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide, ww$totalSO2.bucket)
```
Similarly, the quality of extreme case (0.9% of the wine samples) where total SO2 are lower than 30 mg/L or higher than 250 mg/L is shown to be low. So, if white wine has too little or too much total SO2, the quality unlikely would be higher than 6. 


### Relationship between acetic acid vs. quality

The distribution of acetic acid by quality also suggests the possibility of that high-end values are an indicator of low quality wine.  

#### What are the distributions of quality in the bucket by acetic acid?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create new varaible by cutting into 3 buckets
ww$acetic.bucket <- cut(ww$volatile.acidity,
                             c(0, 0.8, 1.1))

Plot5(ww$volatile.acidity, ww$acetic.bucket)
```
It is very rare (0.1% of the sample size) that the wine would have acetic acid exceeding 0.8 g/L but if white wine has too much acetic acid, the quality unlikely would be higher than 5. 

### Relationship between citric acid vs. quality

Although the median of citric acid is 0.32, there is unusual high count (4% of sample size) at 0.49 g/L and there is zero value for about 0.4% of sample. 

#### What are the distributions of quality when citric acid is at 0.49 or 0?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a new variable by converting numerical to logical data type
ww$citr0.49 <- ww$citric.acid == 0.49 # True being citric.acid == 0.49 and False being != 0.49
ww$citr0 <- ww$citric.acid == 0.0 # True being citric.acid == 0 and False being != 0

# Create density plot and summary table
qplot(x = quality, data = ww, geom = 'density', color = citr0.49)
print("citr0.49")
by(ww$quality, ww$citric.acid == 0.49, summary)

print("citr0")
qplot(x = quality, data = ww, geom = 'density', color = citr0)
by(ww$quality, ww$citric.acid == 0.0, summary)
```
The quality distribution of the group with citric acid of 0.49 seems similar to the distribution by remaining samples, while the wines with zero citric acid are relatively lower in quality, and they unlikely would have quality higher than 6.  


## 2.2.2 Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?
The scatterplot matrix, boxplots and density plots grouped by quality.con and qality.lib, consistently showed relationship of quality with alcohol, density and NaCl, and to a lesser extent with pH, acetic acid, and total SO2. The highest correlation r values with quality were alcohol and density, but were not that strong: 0.436 and -0.307, respectively. And none of single variable alone can explain the variance in quality score more than 19%. I wonder if the combination of two or more variables can make better prediction model for quality. 

It was surprising to see some consistent trends of decreasing sugar with increasing quality from the boxplot although there was no correlation between sugar and quality (r = -0.065). Due to bimodality, some relationship could be hidden. The data of each modal behaved differently with quality. In low sugar group (<2.5 g/L), sugar was positively correlated with quality (r=0.172), while in high sugar group (>2.5 g/L), sugar was negatively correlated with quality (r=-0.156). 

freeSO2, totalSO2, and acetic acid showed that the extremely high or/and low values or even zero values of these variables were associated with low quality wine, though the extreme cases were very rare like about 0.1 to 1 %. 

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?
Strong correlations were detected among density, alcohol, total SO2, sugar, and NaCl. This indicated that these variables might be dependent on each other for some degree. The density of wine depends on content of alcohol, sugar, salts etc. Because alcohol is lighter than water (1kg/L), the more alcohol, the lower density can be achieved. And since solute such as sugar, NaCl, and SO2 contributes to adding density of solution, the more solute, the higher density can be achieved. As mentioned at the univariate analysis, during the fermentation process, sugar is taken up by yeast to produce alcohol. In general, the more alcohol content in wine, the less sugar remains. These correlations were observed either strongly or weakly.
 
### What was the strongest relationship you found?
The correlations between density and alcohol and between density and sugar were the strongest in white wine dataset with r value of -0.78 and 0.756, respectively. This information can be helpful for guiding wine choice based on taste preference such as sweat or dry and heavy- or light-bodied, yet weakly predicting wine based on quality. 

Among physicochemical properties, a single variable that had the strongest correlation with quality was alcohol. Wine with higher content of alcohol tended to be high in quality. Nonetheless, alcohol was explaining only 19% of the variance in quality, thus alcohol cannot be an only parameter for quality prediction model.


## 2.3.1 Multivariate Plots Section

### PCA (Principal component analysis)
One way to deal with multivariate dataset is to reduce dimensionality by using PCA. For the first attempt, I will use all physicochemical properties from ww_trans dataframe. PCA might be very sensitive to different units and differences in variability among the variables. So, I will run PCA with scale which standardizing the variables to have 0 mean and 1 std.


#### What are the stdev and variance of each component, and variance?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a PCA data matrix
ww_trans.pca <- prcomp(ww_trans[,-12], scale=TRUE)
summary(ww_trans.pca)

# Create a scree plot
screeplot(ww_trans.pca, type = "lines")
```


[The Kaiser criterion](http://www.uta.edu/faculty/sawasthi/Statistics/stfacan.html) suggested that we can retain only factors with eigenvalues greater than 1. That means I can keep PC1 through PC4. But the obvious change in slope occurs between 2 and 3, which is the elbow of the scree plot. I can focus on PC1 and PC2.

#### What are the correlations of variables with PC1 and PC2?
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Call the matrix of variable loadings
ww_trans.pca$rotation[ , 1:2] # PC1 and PC2 columns
```

#### Visualize variable loadings
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Call the matrix of variable loadings
qgraph.pca(ww_trans[,-12], factors=2)
```

The PC1 is positively correlated with alcohol but negatively correlated with density, totalSO2, sugar, NaCl, and freeSO2. The PC2 is positively correlated with tartaric acid and citric acid but negatively correlated with pH.

#### Visualize PCA
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=7}
# Create a biplot of individuals as points and variables as arrows
final_pca <- fviz_pca_biplot(ww_trans.pca, repel=TRUE, # repel to avoid overplotting text labels
                label="var", col.var="blue", # show labels in blue and only for variables
                habillage=ww$quality.con, palette="RdBu", # color points by grouping
                title="PCA biplot grouped by quality")+ # change title
    theme_dark()

final_pca
```

As I expect, there is no distinct grouping by quality.con. The classes of quality are highly overlapping. However, there is a general trend of low to high quality from left top to right bottom, where most low quality wines are on the left side (Dim1<0) while most high quality wines are on the right side (Dim1>0). Thus, the quality seems positively related to Dim1 or PC1 which is highly influence by alcohol, density, sugar, NaCl, and total SO2.

#### What is the correlation between PC1 and quality?
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Correlation test 
cor.test(ww_trans.pca$x[ , 1], ww$quality) # using x object to access the coordinates of the individuals (PC1 scores)
```
The correlation r value between PC1 and quality is 0.282, which is not better than correlation between quality and alcohol alone (0.436). So, using all variables into PCA does not improve in explaining quality.

#### How about 3D-plot using PC1, PC2, and PC3?
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Draw a 3D plot
# For this markdown document, I will screenshot the outcome plot and attach the below

#plot3d(ww_trans.pca$x[ , 1:3], col=as.integer(ww$quality.con)) # grouped by quality.con
#rgl.postscript("3d_pca.pdf","pdf")
```
![3D PCA plot](3d_pca.JPG)


The 3D-plot of PCA does not show any better separation of the classes.

#### What about selecting only variables that are often shown to be related each other? Would this improve in explaining quality?
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
qgraph.pca(ww_trans[, c(1,2,3,4,10)], factors=2, rotation="varimax")
```
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a subset of dataframe
ww_trans.subset<- ww_trans[, c(1,2,3,4,10)]

# Create a PCA data matrix
ww_trans.sub.pca <- prcomp(ww_trans.subset, scale=TRUE)
summary(ww_trans.sub.pca)

# Create a scree plot
screeplot(ww_trans.sub.pca, type = "lines")
```
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a biplot of individuals as points and variables as arrows
fviz_pca_biplot((ww_trans.sub.pca), repel=TRUE, # repel to avoid overplotting text labels
                label="var", col.var="blue", # show labels in blue and only for variables

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#### What is the correlation between PC1_selected and quality?
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Correlation test 
cor.test(ww_trans.sub.pca$x[ , 1], ww$quality) # using x object to access the coordinates of the individuals (PC1 scores)
```
It helps little bit. The correlation r value is 0.330 but the individual points become spread out compared to all variables PCA.

#### How about 3D-plot using PC1, PC2, and PC3?
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Draw a 3D plot
# For this markdown document, I will screenshot the outcome plot and attach the below

#plot3d(ww_trans.sub.pca$x[ , 1:3], col=as.integer(ww$quality.con)) 
#rgl.postscript("3d_pca.pdf","pdf")
```

Again, the separation by classes is not very good.


### Building the Linear Model
#### Can the combination of PCA scores explain quality?
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Declare eigenvectors as short name for readibility
PC1 <- ww_trans.pca$x[ , 1]
PC2 <- ww_trans.pca$x[ , 2]
PC3 <- ww_trans.pca$x[ , 3]
PC4 <- ww_trans.pca$x[ , 4]
PC5 <- ww_trans.pca$x[ , 5]
PC6 <- ww_trans.pca$x[ , 6]
PC7 <- ww_trans.pca$x[ , 7]
PC8 <- ww_trans.pca$x[ , 8]
PC9 <- ww_trans.pca$x[ , 9]
PC10 <- ww_trans.pca$x[ , 10]
PC11 <- ww_trans.pca$x[ , 11]

# Building the Linear Model
m1 <- lm(ww$quality ~ PC1)
m2 <- update(m1, ~ . + PC2)
m3 <- update(m2, ~ . + PC3)
m4 <- update(m3, ~ . + PC4)
m5 <- update(m4, ~ . + PC5)
m6 <- update(m5, ~ . + PC6)
m7 <- update(m6, ~ . + PC7)
m8 <- update(m7, ~ . + PC8)
m9 <- update(m8, ~ . + PC9)
m10 <- update(m9, ~ . + PC10)
m11 <- update(m10, ~ . + PC11)

mtable(m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6,m7,m8,m9,m10,m11, sdigits = 3)
```
Unfortunately, the r-squared value of this linear model is 0.302, meaning this model can explain only 30% of variance in quality.

#### Can the combination of transformed variables explain quality?
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Building the Linear Model

m1 <- lm(qual ~ alco, data=ww_trans)
m2 <- update(m1, ~ . + dens)
m3 <- update(m2, ~ . + NaCl.log)
m4 <- update(m3, ~ . + acet.log)
m5 <- update(m4, ~ . + tSO2.sqrt)
m6 <- update(m5, ~ . + tart.log)
m7 <- update(m6, ~ . + fSO2.log)
m8 <- update(m7, ~ . + acet.log)
m9 <- update(m8, ~ . + citr.sqrt)
m10 <- update(m9, ~ . + pH)
m11 <- update(m10, ~ . + suga.log)

mtable(m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6,m7,m8,m9,m10,m11, sdigits = 3)
```
The r-squared value of this linear model is 0.298, explaining 30% of variance in quality, which is similar to the previous model with PCA scores. As I expect, a linear model probably is not the best fit for this dataset.

## 2.3.2 Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?
Yes, to some degree, the combination of two or more variables improved prediction model for quality. From bivariate analysis, the highest r-squared value of linear model by a single variable was about 0.19. But by building model with the combination of variables, the r-squared value increased up to 0.3.

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?
I mostly focused on performing PCA for multivariate analysis and I performed PCA on all variables and compared to PCA on 5 variables which were likely shown to be associated with quality. The PCA plot by the subset of variables did not really improve the separation of quality classes and there was a little improvement on the correlation between PC1 and quality. I may have chosen the variables were highly correlated each other (they seemed dependent to each other) that does not really add any information to it.  

### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the strengths and limitations of your model.
As I mentioned previously, the linear model with combination of variables helped increase a little bit of r-squared value, but not by much. And the prediction power of the model was lower than 45% where predicting all wines as median quality (6) regardless of the physicochemical properties. It indicates that a linear model probably is not the best fit for this dataset. As the distribution of sugar contents (bimodality) and free&total SO2 and acetic acid (threshold effects) hinted, decision tree could be a good candidate, where a model predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

# 3. Final Plots and Summary

### 3.1 Plot One
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a bar plot, similar to histogram
plot(ww$quality.order, xlab = 'Wine Quality Score Evaluated by Experts',
     ylab= "Frequency", main="Distribution of White Wine Quality") 
text(0.75, 150, "0.4%")
text(1.9, 300, "3.3%")
text(3.1, 1600, "29.8%")
text(4.3, 1900, "44.9%")
text(5.5, 1000, "18.0%")
text(6.7, 270, "3.6%")
text(7.9, 150, "0.1%")
text(7, 1900, "(group size / total) * 100%")
```

### Description One
Quality was normally distributed. Quality score 6 is the most common quality for white wines (45%). Most white wines had a quality score between 5 and 6, which accounting for 75% of the total. If I predict that a product of white wine is in quality of 5 or 6, there will be 75% chance to be correct. White wines with a quality score between 5 and 7 and that between 4 and 8 were 92.6% and 99.5%, respectively, whereas it is very rare to be quality 3 or 9. 

### 3.2 Plot Two
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Plot2(ww$alcohol, ww$quality.order, "Alcohol Content (% by volume)")+
  ggtitle("Distribution of Alcohol by Quality")+
  annotate("text", x=1, y=10.7, label="10.5", color="red")+
  annotate("text", x=2, y=10.3, label="10.1", color="red")+
  annotate("text", x=3, y=9.7, label="9.5", color="red")+
  annotate("text", x=4, y=10.7, label="10.5", color="red")+
  annotate("text", x=5, y=11.6, label="11.4", color="red")+
  annotate("text", x=6, y=12.2, label="12.0", color="red")+
  annotate("text", x=7, y=12.6, label="12.5", color="red")+
  annotate("text", x=1, y=14.5, label="Median", color="red")

```

### Description Two
Among physicochemical properties, alcohol has shown to have the strongest linear relationship with quality, especially between 5 and 9. In general, quality increases as alcohol content increases. However, due to such high variability in alcohol within the quality class, alcohol can explain only about 20% of variance in quality with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.436. 

### 3.3 Plot Three
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
final_pca
```

### Description Three
The PCA biplot was constructed by 1st dimension scores on the x-axis and 2nd dimension scores on the y-axis and the points represent individual observations in the dataset, which were color-encoded by quality groups (<6, 6, and >6). The arrows represent correlation of each variables with the two dimension scores: the direction of the arrow represents either positive or negative correlation with both axes, and the length represents the magnitude of correlation coefficient. For example, the arrow of alcohol heads for the positive direction of 1st dimension score with relatively high length. This means that alcohol is strongly and positively correlated with Dim1.

There was a general trend from low to high quality as shifting from left to right, although the separation of groups was not quite clear. One of interesting interactions was that some of physicochemical properties were very dependent on each other. Increase in density of wine was influenced largely by decrease in alcohol and increase in most solutes such as sugar, NaCl, and SO2. In addition, increase in pH (decrease in acidity) was affected by decrease in tartaric acid and citric acid. This plot helped understand the relationship among the physicochemical properties rather than suggest a prediction for sensory quality.

One of my speculations on these trends with wine quality is that too much amount of any solutes might bring unpleasant smell and taste to wine, which was suggested by the arrows of all solute variables were heading to the left where low quality wines more likely present around left-side coordinate. One possible reason could be that high amount of solutes negatively influences the condition for yeast growth. For example, high salt content affects the osmotic pressure in wine, causing cell shrink and slowing down the cell growth and, consequently, the fermentation process.  On the other hands, the reverse, where the fermentation process affects the amount of solutes, could happen. The high amount of the solutes could be resulted from too early or too late harvesting time of wine product. If its harvesting is too early, a large amount of sugar remains in the wine, resulting in being too sweet. If it is too late, alcohol is decomposed to acetic acid, resulting in being too sour. Alternatively, the sensory quality evaluation might be influenced by bias of expert tasters, who have a role to guide sort of standards of wine quality to the wine industry and customers. I think this might lead that wine experts value well-balanced flavors rather than exotic and unique flavors of wine for a broader range of customers. As a result, the wine with extreme or unique range of solutes might be rated low. 

Overall, I have learned that predicting the quality of wine is very complicated and hard to be accomplished solely based on physicochemical properties given. The limitation of these properties is only examining chemicals in the liquid stage. So, any gas form of chemicals such as aroma can be complementary information to existing dataset.

# 4. Reflection
One of my frustrations as a newbie to R was tuning plots one by one, like adjusting bin size, font, color, label, etc. Although I knew that all the plots did not need to be perfect at the exploring stage, tuning steps to improve aesthetic factors in plots took me a large chunk of time. To figure out how to change the visual factors I had to search examples and documentation of each library, because a lot of libraries do not share same functions and arguments. Despite the frustrations, I think R offers advantages such as flexibility and great accessibility to libraries. 
Before this project, I have been using python for exploring datasets (e.g. titanic dataset). Compared to the python jupyter notebook, I have felt that the syntax of R is easier and less restricted, and R provides a lot better graphs and more complex statistics with a simple line of code. But I had hard time to make functions or loops to avoid repeating codes. Unlike python, it lacks iterating functionality. I prefer to copy and paste codes rather than writing function, particularly when I try to draw chart. And another drawback, I felt, is that R runs slower than python and RStuio stopped running several times while I was working on this project. 

I have tried 3 different types of PCA functions: prcomp, and princomp, and psych.principal. How to get a summary about PCA matrix data was quite similar by using the tree methods, but for plotting PCA, each method can be implemented in a different plotting library. They were not exchangeable sometimes. What I wanted to do for the PCA biplot was to have variable vectors and to color data points by a group. I have tried many different arguments and attributes but I found a library (factoextra) to visualize plots specially for PCA with very minimum lines of codes, instead of extracting PCA scores into dataframe and making plots using ggplot.

I think the next step for this project can be performing machine learning algorithms. As I mentioned previously, decision tree can be one of candidate classifiers or regressions.
