# Physicochemical and Sensory Analysis for Wine Quality  
### July 2017, by Jude Moon

========================================================

# 1.Overview
In this project, I will use a white wine quality data set for [Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine](http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/about-vinho-verde), whose data were collected and published by [Cortez et al (2009)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609001377?via%3Dihub). This tidy data set contains 4,898 white wines with 11 variables on quantifying the physicochemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Details and units of the variables are provided [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt). The objectives of the analysis is to explore data to determine (1) whether any relationship between the physicochemical properties and sensory quality exists and (2) if so, which physicochemical properties are the most effective to describe qualty, in other words, which properties are highly correlated with the quality score.

# 2. Analysis
## 2.1.2 Univariate Plots Section

### Data Summary: 
#### What are the data types of the columns?
```{r echo=FALSE}
# Display data type of each column
str(ww)
```
All columns are numeric or continuous, except X and quality. X is wine sample ID, so changing to factor data type would make more sense.

#### What are the data ranges of variables?
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_Summary}
# Change X from int to factor
ww$X <- factor(ww$X, ordered = F)  
summary(ww)
```
The data range of each variable varies, e.g., volatile.acidity ranges from 0.08 to 1.1 while total.sulfur.dioxide ranges from 9 to 440. This suggests that data transformation such as standardazation might require to compare two variables. 

#### Is there any missing values (na) or any zero values?
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_Missing}
#summary(is.na(ww))
summary(ww == 0)
```
There is no missing value, but Variable citric.acid has 19 zeros. I will assume that they are true zeros.

### Quality score: response variable or label feature
#### Can I engineer this variable simpler to interpret?
I will create categorical variables of quality which is integer variable ranged from 3 to 9. One way is to convert into 7 classes (called **quality.order**) and the other is into 3 classes(called **quality.con** and **quality.lib**), where I can simply interpret as bad, ok, and good quality.
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_quality.order}
# Change from int to ordered factor
ww$quality.order <- factor(ww$quality, ordered = T)
str(ww$quality.order)
```

#### What is distribution of quality?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a bar plot, similar to histogram
plot(ww$quality.order, xlab = 'quality.order') 

# Create a function to generate a proportion table in percentage
ProportionTable <- function(col) {
  freq <- table(col)
  prop <- (freq/length(col))*100
  return(prop)
}

# Create a proportion table for quality.order
ProportionTable(ww$quality.order)
```
Quality is normally distributed. Quality score 6 is the most common quality for white wines (45%). Most white wines had a quality score between 5 and 6, which accounting for 75% of the total. If I predict that a product of white wine is in quality of 5 or 6, there will be 75% chance to be correct. White wines with a quality score between 5 and 7 and that between 4 and 8 were 92.6% and 99.5% respectively. 

#### What are the distributions of 3-classes variables?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create new varaibles by cutting into 3 buckets
ww$quality.con <- cut(ww$quality, c(2, 5, 6, 9)) # conservative cutoff
ww$quality.lib <- cut(ww$quality, c(2, 4, 7, 9)) # liberal cutoff

# Craete distribution plots and proportion tables for the new variables
plot(ww$quality.con, xlab = 'quality.con')
ProportionTable(ww$quality.con)
plot(ww$quality.lib, xlab = 'quality.lib')
ProportionTable(ww$quality.lib)
```
I created 2 new variables; each includes 3-classes. One is that I named **quality.con** which cuts off the quality in a conservative way. This considers that wines with the score <6 are low quality, 6 are medium quality, and >6 are high quality. 

The other I named **quality.lib** separates quality in a liberal way, where wine with a wide ranged score from 5 to 7 are considered as ok quality, <5 are low quality, and >7 are high quality.

The distribution of quality.con is relatively even in the 3 classes, while that of quality.lib varies. The purpose of using quality.con would be to find general trends of low and high quality wine, while quality.lib would be better for screening exceptionally low or high quality wine.

### Variables related to features
I sorted some of variables into a related features to help organize variables as a meaningful order.
| Order |     Feature     |                        Variables                        |
|:-----:|:---------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|
|   1   |       body      |                         alcohol                         |
|   2   |      sweet      |                      residual.sugar                     |
|   3   |      salty      |                        chlorides                        |
|   4   |      dense      |                         density                         |
|   5   | sour or acidity |   pH, fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, and citric.acid  |
|   6   |   preservative  | sulphates,total.sulfur.dioxide, and free.sulfur.dioxide |

### Alcohol content
#### How the alcohol variable is distributed? Any new variables are needed?
The weakest and the strongest white wines are 8.0% and 14.2% of alcohol, respectively. The distributions of < 9.5, 9.5-10.4, 10.5-11.4, and >11.4 are even, so I created a new variable called **alcohol.bucket**, which separated alcohol content into 4 classes. This might help with further analysis on its relationship with other variables.

Additionally, as a conventionaly rule, light-bodied wines are 7-11 % alcohol, medium run 11-13%, and full-bodied are over 13%. The body of the wine is how it feels in your mouth. When a wine is full-bodied, it completely coats the palate and tends to feel heavier in the mouth. Also, the texture of the wine either smooth/velvety or coarse/brash contributes to feeling in the mouth. In addition to alcohol.bucket, I created a new variable called **alcohol.body**, which separated alcohol content into 3 classes. This might help to understand relationship between the preference of wine body and wine quality.
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create new varaibles by cutting into buckets
ww$alcohol.bucket <- cut(ww$alcohol,
                             c(7.9, 9.4, 10.4, 11.4, 14.20)) # evenly cutting into 4 classes
ww$alcohol.body <- cut(ww$alcohol,
                             c(7, 11, 13, 15)) # conventional grouping into 3 classes

# Create a function to generate a histogram with color encoding of categorical variable,
# a table, and a proportion table
plot1 <- function(col1, col2) {
  a <- qplot(x = col1, data = ww, binwidth = 0.1, color = I('black'), fill = col2)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(col1), max(col1)),
                     breaks = seq(8, max(col1), 1))
  b <- table(col2)
  c <- ProportionTable(col2)
  return(list(a, b, c))
}

# Explore distribution of alcohol variable
plot1(ww$alcohol, ww$alcohol.bucket)
plot1(ww$alcohol, ww$alcohol.body)
```
The distribution is little bit skewed to the left with mostly (68%) being light-bodied (acohol <= 11). But I don't think that it requires transformation because the skewness seems minor. 

### Sugar content
#### How the residual.sugar variable is distriubted? Any new variables are needed?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of residual.sugar variable
sugar.dist <- qplot(x = residual.sugar, data = ww, binwidth =0.1)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$residual.sugar), max(ww$residual.sugar)),
                     breaks = seq(min(ww$residual.sugar), max(ww$residual.sugar), 10))

# Create new varaible by cutting into 2 buckets
ww$sugar.bucket <- cut(ww$residual.sugar, c(0.5, 2.5, 32)) 

# Transform x to log10
sugar.dist.log <- qplot(x = residual.sugar, data = ww, 
                        binwidth = 0.02, fill = sugar.bucket)+
  scale_x_log10()

grid.arrange(sugar.dist, sugar.dist.log,  ncol=2)
ProportionTable(ww$sugar.bucket)
```
The distribution of residual sugar content is skewed with a right long tail. Thus, the log10 transformation helps better understand the distribution of sugar content. It appears to be bimodal with sugar content peaking at around 1.5 or so and again at 8 g/L or so. I created a new variable called **sugar.bucket**, which separated sugar content into 2 classes: <=2.5 (35%) and >2.5 (65%). 

According to [data info notes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt), it is rare to find wines with less than 1 g/L of sugar. And wines with greater than 45 g/L sugar are considered sweet.
#### What percentage of white wines are sugar content less than 1 g/L sugar or greater than 45 g/L sugar?
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_residual.sugar}
# Craete a function to calculate percentages of wines with less than the value i 
proportion <- function(col, i) {
  prop <- sum(col < i) / length(col) * 100
  return(prop)
}

proportion(ww$residual.sugar, 1)
100-proportion(ww$residual.sugar, 45)
```
The white wine less than 1 g/L is 1.6% of the total. And sweet white wine is only 0.02% of the total, which is very small. I am not sure if "Vinho Verde" white wines are not sweet in general, or if the cutoff of sugar content is more for red wine in general. 
#### How the sugar contents are distriubted for red wines?
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_residual.sugar from red wines}
rw <- read.csv('wineQualityReds.csv')
summary(rw$residual.sugar)
```
Just quick overviewing the stats of residual sugar content from red wines, the Midian is 2.2 and the max is 15.5 g/L which are a lot lower than white wines. Thus, the cutoff (45 g/L) of sugar content for sweet wines is not for red wines either.

### NaCl(salt) content
#### How the nacl content variable is distriubted?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of chlorides variable
NaCl.dist <- qplot(x = chlorides, data = ww, binwidth =0.001)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$chlorides), max(ww$chlorides)),
                     breaks = seq(min(ww$chlorides), max(ww$chlorides), 0.1))

# Transform x to log10
NaCl.dist.log <- qplot(x = chlorides, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_log10()

grid.arrange(NaCl.dist, NaCl.dist.log, ncol=2)
summary(ww$chlorides)

# Calculate percentages of wines with less than 0.1 g/L
proportion(ww$chlorides, 0.1)
```
The distribution of NaCl content is skewed with a right long tail. Thus, the log10 transformation helps better understand the distribution of NaCl content, which looks close to normal. A majority (97.8%) of white wines are less than 0.1 g/L in NaCl content and those between 0.04 and 0.05 are common.

### Density
#### How the density variable is distriubted?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of density variable
density.dist <- qplot(x = density, data = ww, binwidth =0.0001)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$density), max(ww$density)),
                     breaks = seq(0.980,  max(ww$density), 0.01))

# Zoom in the x scale
density.dist.zoom <- qplot(x = density, data = ww, binwidth =0.0001)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$density), quantile(ww$density, 0.999)),
                     breaks = seq(0.980, quantile(ww$density, 0.999), 0.004))

grid.arrange(density.dist, density.dist.zoom, ncol=2)
summary(ww$density)

# Calculate percentages of wines with less than 1 Kg/L
100-proportion(ww$density, 1)
```
The lightest and heaviest wines are 0.9871 and 1.0390 Kg/L in density, respectively. Most white wines are between 0.9917 and 0.9961 Kg/L in density. Although the distribution is skewed to the right, log or square root transformations did not improve normality. Excluding top 0.1% helps to better understand the distribution. 
Density possibly contributes to taste of wine. Density depends on the alcohol and sugar contents. The wines heavier than or equal to water (1 Kg/L) are rare (1.9%). 
 
### Acidity including pH, fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, and citric.acid
#### pH
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of pH variable
qplot(x = pH, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$pH), max(ww$pH)),
                     breaks = seq(2.7, max(ww$pH), 0.1))

summary(ww$pH)
```

#### tartaric acid content (nonvolatile or fixed acidity)
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of fixed.acidity variable
tartaric.dist <- qplot(x = fixed.acidity, data = ww, binwidth =0.1)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$fixed.acidity), max(ww$fixed.acidity)),
                     breaks = seq(3, max(ww$fixed.acidity), 1))

# Transform x to log10
tartaric.dist.log <- qplot(x = fixed.acidity, data = ww, binwidth =0.005)+
  scale_x_log10()

grid.arrange(tartaric.dist, tartaric.dist.log, ncol=2)

summary(ww$fixed.acidity)
```


#### acetic acid content (volatile acidity)
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of volatile.acidity variable
acetic.dist <- qplot(x = volatile.acidity, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$volatile.acidity), max(ww$volatile.acidity)),
                     breaks = seq(0.1, max(ww$volatile.acidity), 0.2))

# Transform x to log10
acetic.dist.log <- qplot(x = volatile.acidity, data = ww, binwidth =0.02)+
  scale_x_log10()

grid.arrange(acetic.dist, acetic.dist.log, ncol=2)

summary(ww$volatile.acidity)

```

#### citric acid content
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of citric.acid variable
citric.dist <- qplot(x = citric.acid, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$citric.acid), max(ww$citric.acid)),
                     breaks = seq(min(ww$citric.acid), max(ww$citric.acid), 0.4))

# Transform x to square root
citric.dist.sqrt <- qplot(x = citric.acid, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_sqrt()

grid.arrange(citric.dist, citric.dist.sqrt, ncol=2)
summary(ww$citric.acid)

summary(ww$citric.acid == 0.49)  # count of the wines with 0.49 g/L citric acid
# Zoom in the x scale
qplot(x = citric.acid, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.45, 0.55),
                     breaks = seq(0.45, 0.55, 0.01))

```
(1) pH is already in log term so the distribution is normal. The lowest and the highest in pH of white wine are 2.72 and 3.82, respectively. The most common pH was between 3.1 and 3.3.

(2) tartaric acid: the lowest and highest in tartaric acid content are 3.8 and 14.2 g/L, respectively. Most white wines are between 6.3 and 7.3 g/L in tartaric acid. 

(3) acetic acid: the lowest and highest in acetic acid content are 0.08 and 1.1 g/L, respectively. Most white wines are between 0.21 and 0.32 g/L in acetic acid. 

(4) citric acid: the lowest and highest in citric acid content are 0 and 1.66 g/L, respectively. There are 19 zeros. Most white wines are between 0.27 and 0.39 g/L in citric acid. There is unusual high count at 0.49 g/L. 

Because the distributions of the three acid variables are skewed to the right, log transformation helps to get better distribution for tartaric and acetic acids, and the values of citric acid (having zeros) are square root transformed. 

According to the [data info notes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt), excess amount of acetic acid can cause an unpleasant and vinegar taste, while citric acid can add freshness and flavor to wines. Thus, the 4 variables indicating acidity of wine are likely related to each other as well as to wine quality. 

### Antimicrobial and antioxidant contents, including sulphates, total.sulfur.dioxide, and free.sulfur.dioxide
#### K2SO4 content (potassium sulphate)
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distsribution of sulphates variable
K2SO4.dist <- qplot(x = sulphates, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$sulphates), max(ww$sulphates)),
                     breaks = seq(0.2, max(ww$sulphates), 0.1))

# Transform x to log10
K2SO4.dist.log <- qplot(x = sulphates, data = ww, binwidth =0.01)+
  scale_x_log10()

grid.arrange(K2SO4.dist, K2SO4.dist.log, ncol=2)

summary(ww$sulphates)
```

#### Total SO2 content
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of total.sulfur.dioxide variable
t.SO2.dist <- qplot(x = total.sulfur.dioxide, data = ww, binwidth = 1)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide), max(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide)),
                     breaks = seq(min(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide), max(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide), 50))

# Transform x to square root
t.SO2.dist.sqrt <- qplot(x = total.sulfur.dioxide, data = ww, binwidth =0.1)+
  scale_x_sqrt()

grid.arrange(t.SO2.dist, t.SO2.dist.sqrt, ncol=2)

summary(ww$total.sulfur.dioxide)
```

#### Free SO2 content
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Explore distribution of free.sulfur.dioxide variable
f.SO2.dist <- qplot(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, data = ww, binwidth =1)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide), max(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide)),
                     breaks = seq(0, max(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide), 50))

# Transform x to log10
f.SO2.dist.log <- qplot(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, data = ww, binwidth =0.02)+
  scale_x_log10()

grid.arrange(f.SO2.dist, f.SO2.dist.log, ncol=2)

summary(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide)

summary(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide > 50)  # count of the wines with higher than 50 mg/L

sum(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide > 50) / length(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide) * 100  # percentages of wines with less than 50 mg/L
```
(1) sulphates: the lowest and highest in sulphates content are 0.22 and 1.08 g/L, respectively. Most white wines are between 0.41 and 0.55 g/L in sulphates. 

(2) total SO2: the lowest and highest in total SO2 content are 9 and 440 mg/L, respectively. Most white wines are between 108 and 167 mg/L in total SO2. 

(3) free SO2: the lowest and highest in free SO2content are 2 and 289 mg/L, respectively. Most white wines are between 23 and 46 mg/L in free SO2. 

Because the distributions of all three variables are skewed to the right, log transformation helps to get better distribution for sulphates and free SO2. And the values of total SO2 are square root transformed. 

According to the [data info notes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt), free SO2 prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine, but over 50 mg/L of free SO2 (about 18%), SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine. Thus, free SO2 is likely related to wine quality. In addition, sulfates are an additive that contributes to SO2 gas, and so all three variables indicating sulfur content are likely related to each other.


## 2.1.2 Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?
There were 4,898 white wines in the dataset with 1 sensory data (quality score) and 11 physicochemical properties (alcohol, sugar, NaCl, tartaric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, K2SO4, total and free SO2 contents, pH, and density). All physicochemical properties were numeric variables, and the quality variable was integer.

Other observations:
- The most common white wines were quality score of 6.
- Alcohol content ranged from 8 to 14.2% and the median alcohol was 10.4%.
- Sugar content ranged from 0.6 to 65.8 g/L and most white wines were around 2 and 10 g/L.
- Salt content was less than 0.1 g/L for most white wines (98%) with the median of 0.043 g/L.
- Density ranged from 0.9871 to 1.0390 Kg/L with the median of 0.9937 Kg/L.
- Acidity ranged from pH 2.72 to pH 3.82 with the median of pH 3.18.
- The medians of tartaric, acetic, and citric acid contents were 6.8, 0.26, and 0.32 g/L, respectively.
- The medians of K2SO4, total and free SO2 contents were 0.47 g/L, 134 mg/L, and 34 mg/L, respectively.


### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
The main feature in the data set was quality score. I would like to determine which physicochemical properties (input variables) are best for predicting the quality of white wine (output variable). The measurements of physicochemical properties could be responsible for smell and taste of white wine. For examples, sugar for sweetness, NaCl for saltiness, acidity for sourness, acetic acid for vinegary taste, citric acid for citrus flavor, and free SO2 for pungent odor. I think that the balance among these flavors can contribute to the wine quality, thus some combination of physicochemical properties can be used to complement sensory tests or build a predictive model to sensory tests.

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
The article (Cortez 2009) hinted that there is relationship between alcohol and residual sugar contents since alcohol production depends on grape sugar level and fermentation process. After reading some basics about wine tasting, too much or too little of alcohol, sweets, acids are not preferred and balancing among the ingredients is required for good quality. Focusing on high quality wines to compare how physicochemical properties of high quality wines are distributed differently from the others might help to understand any consistent trends for high quality. 

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?
I created 6 new variables including quality.order, quality.con, quality.lib, alcohol.bucket, alcohol.body, sugar.bucket. 

- quality.order is a variable changed from existing variable quality, which was numeric, to ordered factor with 7 levels.
- quality.con is a variable also changed from variable quality, by cutting into evenly distributed 3 levels. 
- quality.lib is a variable also changed from variable quality, by cutting into unproportionally distributed 3 levels.
- alcohol.bucket is a variable changed from existing variable alcohol, by evenly cutting numbers into 4 levels. 
- alcohol.body is a variable also changed from alcohol to 3-leveled categoroy, by following conventional body levels of wines.
- sugar.bucket is a variable changed from existing variable residual.sugar and separated into 2 levels guided by bimodal distribution. 

Reasoning: ordered or categorical factors are useful to color data as well as draw statistics on plots for further analysis.

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?
I log- or square root-transformed the right skewed distributions. The distributions of NaCl, sugar, tartaric and acetic acids, K2SO4, free SO2 were strongly skewed to the right, so log-transformation was used to reduce the strong right skewness. The transformed distribution for sugar appeared bimodal with the sugar peaking at around 1.5 or so and again at 8 g/L or so. Some wines had zero values of citric acid, so square root transformation was applied to reduce the right skewness for citric acid. The distribution of total SO2 was weakly skewed, so squared root transformation was used.

### Numeric variables analysis: regressions
### Multivariate Outliers
I will use multivariate approach to detect outliers instead of looking at all pairs of variables. This way I can detect universal outliers shown across all the variables. But there might be more detectable outliners by pair-wise approach.

#### Is there any outlier?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create new dataframes including only numeric variables
ww_subset <- ww[c(2:13)]

# Create Chi-Square Plot to identify outliers using mvoutlier package
chisq.plot(ww_subset)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, remove_outlier}
# Identify the outlier from chi square plot using the interacting plot 
ww[2782, ]

# Remove observation of 2782
ww <- ww[-c(2782), ]
ww_subset <- ww_subset[-c(2782), ]

dim(ww)
dim(ww_subset)
```
The outlier detected is X = 2782 with Sq. Mahalanobis Distance of 3800. Observation 2782 has extreme values in acetic acid, sugar, and density, and the values of the other variables are far from the medians. I decided to delete this row.

I have noticed that the columns' names are too long for such scatterplot matrix so I will rename all the columns for simplicity and readibility on the plots.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, rename_col}
# Rename variables 
ww_subset <- rename(ww_subset, 
       c("alcohol" = "alco",
         "residual.sugar" = "sugar",
         "chlorides" = "NaCl",
         "density" = "dens",
         "fixed.acidity" = "tart", 
         "volatile.acidity" = "acet", 
         "citric.acid" = "citr",          
         "sulphates" = "K2SO4",
         "free.sulfur.dioxide" = "fSO2",
         "total.sulfur.dioxide" = "tSO2",
         "quality" = "qual"))
```

I will generate a new datafram that includes log- or squareroot-transformed data according to the univariate analysis results.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, transformed_dataframe}
# Create another dataframe including transformed data
tart.log <- log10(ww_subset$tart)
acet.log <- log10(ww_subset$acet)
citr.sqrt <- sqrt(ww_subset$citr)
suga.log <- log10(ww_subset$sugar)
NaCl.log <- log10(ww_subset$NaCl)
fSO2.log <- log10(ww_subset$fSO2)
tSO2.sqrt <- sqrt(ww_subset$tSO2)
dens <- ww_subset$dens
pH <- ww_subset$pH
SO4.log <- log10(ww_subset$K2SO4)
alco <- ww_subset$alco
qual <- ww_subset$qual

ww_trans <- data.frame(alco, suga.log, NaCl.log, dens,
                       pH, tart.log, acet.log, citr.sqrt,
                       SO4.log, tSO2.sqrt, fSO2.log, qual)
```

#### What does chi-square plot look like after transformation? Is there any outlier?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
chisq.plot(ww_subset) 
chisq.plot(ww_trans)
chisq.plot(ww_trans[ , -4]) # without sugar variable
```
I notice a great difference in range of x-axis. By transforming variables, it helps reduce overall outliers, plus plotting it without sugar variable improves a lot.


### Scatterplot Matrix
#### What pairs of variables have strong correlations?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggpairs(ww_trans, 
        lower = list(continuous = wrap(ggally_points, size = 0.2)),
        upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size = 4, color = 'black'))) + 
  theme_void()
```
The main feature of interest is quality. Alcohol, density, NaCl, acetic acid, and total SO2 seem to have medium to weak correlation with quality score. 

Other than main features, density is an interesting variable, which has strong correlations with alcohol, sugar, and total SO2 and weak correlations with NaCl, free SO2, and tartaric acid. 

Alcohol is correlated with NaCl, total SO2, sugar, and free SO2. 

pH is correlated with tartaric and citric acid and K2SO4, but not with acetic acid. Citric acid was weakly correlated with tartaric and acetic acids. 

Free and total SO2 was strongly correlated. Sugar was correlated with free and total SO2. NaCl and total SO2 weakly were correlated.

### Categorical variable analysis: boxplot or density plot
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}
# Create categorical variables of quality in ww_trans dataframe
#ww_trans$quality.con <- ww$quality.con
#ww_trans$quality.lib <- ww$quality.lib
```
### Boxplots grouped by quality.con
I will create boxplots of all physicochemical properties grouped by quality.cons (<6, 6, >6) to find general trends. 
#### Is there any noticeable trend from low and middle to high quality, which was not detected from correllation analysis?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a function to generate a boxplot with x-axis as quality.con and y-axis as input column
plot2 <- function(col, quality, df, lab) {
  qplot(x= quality, y= col, data = df, geom = 'boxplot', ylab = lab)+ 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/10, color = 'royalblue')
}

# Iterate every column to generate boxplot from ww_trans dateframe
for (i in 1:11) {
  print(plot2(ww_trans[ , i], ww$quality.con, ww_trans, colnames(ww_trans)[i]))
}
```
Alcohol, sugar, NaCl, density, pH, and total SO2 seem to have consistent trends from low to high quality wines. For the other properties, in contrast, the high quality wines share a similar distribution of the total. 

It is surprising to see some consistent trends of decreasing sugar with increasing quality from the boxplot although there is no correlation between sugar and quality (r = -0.065). This makes me wonder if linear relationship was hidden due to bimodality.

Although boxplots show the general trends, I am not sure the differences are statistically significant or not. Thus, I will perform one-way ANOVA test on each variable by quality.con.
#### Are the differences statistically significant?
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots_ANOVA}
# Create a function to generate ANOVA table
aov_table <- function (col) {
  col.aov <- aov(col ~ ww$quality.con)
  summary(col.aov)
}

# Iterate every column to generate an ANOVA table from ww_trans dateframe
for (i in 1:11) {
  a <- colnames(ww_trans)[i] 
  b <- aov_table(ww_trans[ , i])
  print(list(a, b))
}
```
Apperantly, the ANOVA test is not very helpful in this case because all variables significantly vary by quality.con.  

### Density plots grouped by quality.lib
I will create density plots of all physicochemical properties grouped by quality.lib (<5, 5-7, >7) to find the trends of low-end and high-end cases. The advantage of density plot is the area under the curve is normalized for imbalanced class sizes.
#### Is there any noticeable trend from low to high quality?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a function to generate a boxplot with x-axis as quality.con and y-axis as input column
plot3 <- function(col, quality, df, lab) {
  qplot(x= col, data = df, color = quality, geom = 'density', xlab = lab)+
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdBu")+
    theme_dark()
}

# Iterate every columns to generate boxplots from ww_trans dateframe
for (i in 1:11) {
  print(plot3(ww_trans[ , i], ww$quality.lib, ww_trans, colnames(ww_trans)[i]))
}
```
The density plots of alcohol, NaCl, density, and pH are reconfirming that the distribution of very high quality differs from that of very low quality for these properties. And acetic acid, SO4, and free SO2 seem to have distinct trends from low to high quality, which were not detected from boxplots.

### Density plots grouped by sugar.bucket
Due to bimodality of residual.sugar distribution, I will take look at the distributions separately by two groups (<2.5, >2.5).

#### What are the distributions of residual.sugar in the two separate groups? And what are the distribution of quality in the two groups?
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create density plots separated by sugar.bucket
sugar.freq.log <- qplot(x= residual.sugar, data = ww, color = sugar.bucket, geom = 'density')+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdBu")+
  theme_dark()

suga.qual.freq <- qplot(x = quality, data = ww, binwidth = 1, geom = 'density', color = sugar.bucket)
  scale_color_brewer()+
  theme_dark()

grid.arrange(sugar.freq.log, suga.qual.freq, ncol=2)

print("residual.sugar")
by(ww$residual.sugar, ww$sugar.bucket, summary)

print("quality")
by(ww$quality, ww$sugar.bucket, summary)
```
The distribution of each group is close to normal with its own central. Low sugar group (<2.5) has a median of 1.5 while high sugar group (>2.5) had a median of 8.2. Despite the bimodality of residual.sugar distribution, the quality in both groups is distributed very similarily, with the quality median of 6. 

I investigate the statistical summary and regression with quality separately by two groups (<2.5, >2.5)
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create scatterplots of quality vs. sugar, separated by sugar.bucket
PlotScatter2Var <- function(dataset, x, y, opts = NULL) {
  ggplot(dataset, aes_string(x = x, y = y)) +
   geom_point(alpha = 1/20, position = position_jitter(h = 0.2), size = 2) +
   geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
}
PlotScatter3Var <- function(dataset, x, y, z, opts = NULL) {
  ggplot(dataset, aes_string(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +
   geom_point(alpha = 1/10, position = position_jitter(h = 0), size = 2) +
   geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
   scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdBu")+
   theme_dark()
}
qual.suga1 <- PlotScatter2Var(ww, "quality", "residual.sugar")

qual.suga1.1 <- qual.suga1 + scale_y_log10()

qual.suga1.2 <- qual.suga1 + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10", limits = c(min(ww$residual.sugar), 2.5))

qual.suga1.3 <- qual.suga1 + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10", limits = c(2.5, max(ww$residual.sugar)))

qual.suga2 <- PlotScatter3Var(ww, "quality", "residual.sugar", "sugar.bucket") + 
  scale_y_log10()

grid.arrange(qual.suga1.1, qual.suga2, ncol=2)
#grid.arrange(qual.suga1.2, qual.suga1.3, ncol=2)

# Correlation on Subsets
with(subset(ww, sugar.bucket == "(0.5,2.5]"), cor.test(residual.sugar, quality))
with(subset(ww, sugar.bucket == "(2.5,32]"), cor.test(residual.sugar, quality))
```
Comment: The correlation with quality was improved a little bit by grouping. Low sugar group was positively correlated with quality (r=0.172), while high sugar group was negatively correlated with quality (r=-0.156).

### Relationship between SO2 vs. quality
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots_freeSO2}
# Create new varaible by cutting into 4 buckets
ww$freeSO2.bucket <- cut(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide,
                             c(1, 5, 50, 120, 290))

# density plot separated by sugar.bucket
qplot(x = quality, data = ww, geom = 'density', color = freeSO2.bucket)+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdBu")+
  theme_dark()
  
qplot(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, data = ww, geom = 'density', color = quality.order)+
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdBu")+
  theme_dark()

# Calculate percentage of each bucket
sum(ww$freeSO2.bucket == "(1,5]") / length(ww$freeSO2.bucket) * 100
sum(ww$freeSO2.bucket == "(5,50]") / length(ww$freeSO2.bucket) * 100
sum(ww$freeSO2.bucket == "(50,120]") / length(ww$freeSO2.bucket) * 100
sum(ww$freeSO2.bucket == "(120,290]") / length(ww$freeSO2.bucket) * 100

by(ww$free.sulfur.dioxide, ww$freeSO2.bucket, summary)
by(ww$quality, ww$freeSO2.bucket, summary)
```
Comment: free SO2 over 50 mg/L becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine, but the measurement of free SO2 alone was not necessary to determine wine quality. Majority of wines (82%) had free SO2 below 50 mg/L. The density plot showed that the quality of wine with below and above 50 mg/L of free SO2 were distributed similarly. However, the quality of extreme case where free SO2 are lower than 5 mg/L or higher than 120 mg/L was shown to be low. So, if white wine had too little or too much free SO2, the quality unlikely would be higher than 6. This suggest that free SO2 is required at a certain level (20-50 mg/L) to compromise between preservation purpose (antioxidant) and good smell, but there is no linear relationship between free SO2 and quality.


### Rerationship between acidity vs. quality
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots_acetic.acid}

# Create new varaible by cutting into 2 buckets
ww$acetic.bucket <- cut(ww$volatile.acidity,
                             c(0, 0.8, 1.1))

# density plot separated by sugar.bucket

```

## 2.2.2 Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?
The scatterplot matrix, boxplots and density plots grouped by quality.con and qality.lib, consistently showed relationship of quality with alcohol and density, and to a lesser extent with NaCl, acetic acid, and total SO2. The highest correlation r values with quality were alcohol and density, but were not that strong: 0.436 and -0.307, respectively. And none of single variable alone can explain the variance in quality score more than 20%. I wonder if the combination of two or more variables can make better prediction model for quality. 

It was surprising to see some consistent trends of decreasing sugar with increasing quality from the boxplot although there was no correlation between sugar and quality (r = -0.065). Due to bimodality, some relationship could be hidden. Actually, the data of each modal behaved differently with quality. In low sugar group (<2.5 g/L), sugar was positively correlated with quality (r=0.172), while in high sugar group (>2.5 g/L), sugar was negatively correlated with quality (r=-0.156). 

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?
Strong correlations were detected among density, alcohol, total SO2, sugar, and NaCl. This indicated that these variables might be dependent on each other for some degree. The density of wine depends on content of alcohol, sugar, salts etc. Because alcohol is lighter than water (1kg/L), the more alcohol, the lower density can be achieved. And since solute such as sugar, NaCl, and SO2 contributes to adding density of solution, the more solute, the higher density can be achieved. As mentioned at the univariate analysis, during the fermentation process, sugar is taken up by yeast to produce alcohol. In general, the more alcohol content in wine, the less sugar remains. All of these correlations were observed either strongly or weakly.
 
### What was the strongest relationship you found?
The correlations between density and alcohol and between density and sugar were the strongest in white wine dataset with r value of -0.78 and 0.756, respectively. This information can be helpful for guiding wine choice based on taste preference such as sweat or dry and heavy- or light-bodied, but for predicting wine based on quality. 

Of physicochemical properties, the strongest correlation between a single variable and quality was alcohol and quality. Wine with higher content of alcohol tended to be high in quality. Nonetheless, alcohol was explaining 20% of the variance in quality, thus alcohol cannot be an only parameter for quality prediction model.

sapply(ww_trans_stdise, mean)
