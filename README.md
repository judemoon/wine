# Explore and Summarize White Wine Quality Data Using R

July 2017, by Jude Moon

## Overview

In this project, I explored a white wine quality data set for [Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine](http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/about-vinho-verde), whose data were collected and published by [Cortez et al (2009)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609001377?via%3Dihub). This tidy data set contains 4,898 white wines with 11 variables on quantifying the physicochemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Details and units of the variables are provided [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt). The objectives of the analysis is to summarize the data to determine (1) whether any relationship between the physicochemical properties and sensory quality exists and (2) if so, which physicochemical properties are the most effective to describe quality, in other words, which properties are highly correlated with the quality score.
